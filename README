## Synopsis

A set of [Tsung](http://tsung.erlang-projects.org/)-based scripts intended to stress-test the websocket part of the new PdfFiller application.

## Code Example

This is a one-call solution, just fire up the SSH script and a predefined (*X* / *Y*) avalanche of requests will fly towards `dev18.pdffiller.com`.

```
./run_websocket_tests.sh
```

## Installation

The environment requires latest [Tsung](http://tsung.erlang-projects.org/) load testing tool and all its dependencies. At the moment of this file' creation the latest pre-built Ubuntu-targeted package was [tsung_1.5.2a-1](http://tsung.erlang-projects.org/dist/ubuntu/trusty/tsung_1.5.2a-1_all.deb).

## API Reference
